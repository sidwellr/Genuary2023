Prompt: Perfect loop / Infinite loop / endless GIFs

I used JWildfire for this. I took a gnarl flame I created a few years ago and added motion curves to animate it, ensuring that the first and last frames are the same so it will loop. There are a couple of glitches on the right side; I can't figure out where they are coming from.

JWildfire parameters in gen1.flame.
