Prompt: Intersections

I traced a bunch of circles (and a couple of squares for variety) on a piece of paper and colored the intersections with markers. Someday I'd like to write a program to generate this kind of art automatically, but today I wanted to do it by hand so I can compare the result and try to make the automation more organic.

Here's a similar piece I made in December 2021 with colored pencil at a Jump the Moon studio event.
