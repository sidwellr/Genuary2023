# Genuary 13, 2023
Prompt: Something youâ€™ve always wanted to learn

I've been doing fractal and other generative art for years, but have only dabbled in traditional art. So I started taking a painting class this year from Michael Bingham at Jump the Moon studio (jumpthemoon.org). We've only had two classes so far, but I'm sharing my work in progress for Genuary today. It's a color wheel using a Russian impressionist method. We first painted the primary and secondary colors using acrylic paint on a board. This can be seen on the right side; it's the underpainting. Then we divided each wedge into four parts and mixed different colors of oil paints for each section: a primary or secondary color and a tint, shade, and neutral based on that color. This can be seen on the left side.
