Prompt: Deliberately break one of your previous images, take one of your previous works and ruin it. Alternatively, remix one of your previous works.

I started with one of the first fractals I made back in 2011 and tweaked it. My goal was to improve it, but I actually like the original better, so I guess I did ruin it!

My remix:
