Prompt: Definitely not a grid

I made some spin art, one of the favorites of the local Jump the Moon studio (https://jumpthemoon.org/). You attach the surface to a spinning platform, pour on paint, and start it spinning so the paint is forced outward. I used acrylic paint on cardboard. No grids involved!
