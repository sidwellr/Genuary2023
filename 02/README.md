Prompt: Made in 10 minutes

I used JWildfire and to keep it to 10 minutes, I used a script to generate a random starting point and tweaked that to get my final piece.

The script I used was *The Rhythm Script* by Lynda McDaniel, which I downloaded from the [JWildfire Sanctuary](https://www.jwfsanctuary.club/downloads/scripts/lynda-mcdaniels-scripts/the-rhythm-script/), a great resource for JWildfire users.

Here is the starting point generated by the script:

Here is my final piece:

A couple of intermediate steps are included as well.
