Prompt: A grid inside a grid inside a grid

The first thing that came to mind with this prompt is a quadtree. And I have just recently written a program that uses a quadtree to generate a multi-scale Truchet tiling. So I'm using that for today! I turned up the quadtree outline to better show the grid inside a grid inside a grid.
